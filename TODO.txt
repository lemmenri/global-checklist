Notes on Redux: 

// Define an initial state value for the app
const initialState = {
  value: 0
}

// Create a reducer function that determins what the new state should be when something happens in the app
function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'counter/incremented':
      return { ...state, value: state.value + 1 }
    case 'counter/decremented':
      return { ...state, value: state.value - 1 }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Create a new Redux store with the 'createStore' function, and use the 'counterReducer' for the update logic
const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer)

// Using the store in the UI
function render() {
  const state  store.getState()
  // do something with the state
}
render()
store.subscribe(render)

// Dispatch actions
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })



Add the @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux packages
Create a Redux store using RTK's configureStore API, and pass in at least one reducer function
Import the Redux store into your application's entry point file (such as src/index.js)
Wrap your root React component with the <Provider> component from React-Redux, like:

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
